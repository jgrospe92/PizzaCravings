# PizzaCravings
 A Pizza Android app

# Instruction
 To make this app work, make sure you are using the latest android studio version.

 # Description
 This app is built using java. I used object oriented programing and polymorphism to make coding more efficient. I used HasHmap to store the user credentials. But for a bigger project I would prefer storing it into a database.
